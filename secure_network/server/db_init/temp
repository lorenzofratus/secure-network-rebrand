		Ensuring the security of these applications is essential to keep your information and services secure, minimizing the risk of cyber attacks. Security analysis is necessary even when end-users cannot directly operate on the application, like when dealing with APIs and web services.
		
		Using a methodology based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide, Secure Network analyses your web applications, detailing every discovered vulnerability and suggests how to resolve it. Furthermore, all detected vulnerabilities are classified using the OWASP Risk Scoring Methodology`,

		Through a process analysis based on the OWASP Mobile Project methodology, Secure Network’s engineers check the security of the application. Analyses are also performed on the transmission protocols to ensure that information is safety transmitted to the back-end systems. The analysis is completed by the Penetration Test of back-end system with a methodology similar to that used for Penetration Test of Web Application and Web Services.`,

For this reason, analysing the security of such software is an important task for any company that relies on them for its critical processes.

	The security analysis of these kinds of applications, however, presents different problems than their web and mobile counterparts, and that must be addressed with particular care. For this reason, Secure Network developed a custom methodology, based on the indications of OWASP, to ensure that even the analysis of these applications are extensive and complete.`,

	In addition, to make sure that the application is safe at other levels, Secure Network analyzes the obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques used to protect the application source code from reverse engineering.`,

To prevent wireless networks from becoming uncontrolled entry points to internal networks and critical business systems, it’s necessary to identify and fix the security issues that can lead to their compromise.

	Using a tested methodology, which includes an analysis of the network’s infrastructure, targeted attack scenarios are designed to identify the existing vulnerabilities and their possible exploitation in order to compromise the network integrity. For this purpose, specialised tools are employed to get a detailed insight of the issues, which are then sorted according to their impact in order to help you fix the critical problems first.`,

Workstations and their users are indeed one of the favourite targets for attackers who exploit people’s lack of attention the reduced security measures implemented to gain access to internal networks and steal confidential information.

	The workstations analysis is performed on standard systems configured for your employees, in order to determine whether it is possible to carry out real attacks on these systems or to exploit them as a bridge to more critical systems. Furthermore, the threats often do not come exclusively from the outside, but also arise within company, which must therefore protect against rogue employees who intend to steal critical information or, more generally, cause economic damage. To check the security of the company against possible internal attacks, we place ourselves in the same conditions of your employees and we use the standard workstations to perform the analysis.`,

Among these was VASTO (Virtualization Assessment Toolkit), the first toolkit for penetration testing of virtual networks, including solutions by VMware, Xen and Oracle.
	
	With a wide experience in this field, Secure Network challenges your virtual infrastructure through targeted attacks aimed at its compromise. Tests may also include the review of the infrastructure management process and of network configuration in order to identifiy further vulnerabilities.`,
