<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- ![Home Page Screenshot](../assets/screen-1.png?raw=true) -->

This project has been developed as final assignment for the _Hypermedia Applications_ course held by Professor Franca Garzotto at _Politecnico di Milano_.

### Built With

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
-   [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
-   [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

<!-- SERVER SIDE -->

### Backend

To support the frontend, an Express.js server with REST APIs has been developed. It has the objective of implementing several http endpoints which allow the interaction with the database. There are two main files:

-   `api.js` implements enpoints
-   `db_conn.js` defines the structure of the database and initializes it by reading configurations from another file.

<!-- ADDITIONAL PLUGINS -->

### Plugins

- `Dotenv:` used to retrieve database credentials from the environment also in development mode. It is a best practice to retrieve such these information from the environment, rather than hardcoding them.

- `Redirect SSL:` used in order to force the usage of HTTPS protocol, rather than sending data over plain HTTP.

- `Multi Modal Chatbot Creator:` experimental framework developed by PHD students of the Hypermedia Application course to support a multi modal chatbot.

- `Store:` used both to support chatbot features and static content used in several sections in order to avoid replication of data.

- `Router:` VueJS plugin which allow to manage easily inter and intra page routing. In addition, we developed a customized middleware plugin to support smooth scrolling behaviour for the router.

- `Robots:` Nuxt plugin that manages the creation of the robots.txt file.

<!-- BEST PRACTICES -->

## Best Practices

In this section we will briefly outline how our usage of the framework was compliant to the best practices for our specific domain.

Besides following the teachings of our tutors, we used `ESLint` to help us comply with specific rules while writing the code.
Some examples of best practises that were imposed by this linter are:
- The usage of shorthands (`:` instead of `v-bind`, `@` instead of `v-on`, ...).
- The usage of proper casing (_kebab-case_ in the template and _CamelCase_ in the JavaScript).
- The correct usage of `v-` directives (unique `:key` with `v-for`, no `v-if` with `v-for`, ...).

Moreover, we preferred to implement many small components rather than few bulky ones.  
This allowed us to obtain code that is much easier to read (therefore to maintain) and to reuse in multiple parts of the website, usually only changing the props values.

As for the usage of `NuxtJS`, in different occasions we exploited the lifecycle hooks that it offers to perform actions on the data or the UI.  
We also built different stores to keep static data that needs to be easily modifiable (`menu.js` contains the lists of landmarks and of social links) or that is used in multiple pages (`threats.js`).  
Again, we took advantage of the routing mechanism of `NuxtJS` to implement a middleware that intercepts hash links (e.g., `/contacts#email`) and smoothly scrolls to the pointed section without displaying the hash in the URL bar.

Regarding SEO and accesibility, we made sure that every page has a unique title, that the whole website is navigable using the _Tab_ key and that every input has a label to allow screen readers to correctly detect it.  
We also used _WAVE_ and _Google Lighthouse_ to analyze the website.  
This lead to some adjustments, the most relevant of which is a slight change in the main color (from ![#00a6fb](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00a6fb/000000?text=+) `#00a6fb` to ![#007cbd](https://via.placeholder.com/15/007cbd/000000?text=+) `#007cbd`) in order to satisfy contrast requirements.

Finally, we introduced an external plugin to force the communication using _HTTPS_ rather than plain _HTTP_ as prescribed by the latest security guidelines.
