<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- ![Home Page Screenshot](../assets/screen-1.png?raw=true) -->

This project has been developed as final assignment for the _Hypermedia Applications_ course held by Professor Franca Garzotto at _Politecnico di Milano_.

### Built With

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
-   [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
-   [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

<!-- SERVER SIDE -->

### Backend

To support the frontend, an express rest api has been deveped. It has the objective of implementing several http endpoints which allow the interaction with the database. There are two main files:

-   `api.js` implements enponts
-   `db_conn.js` defines the structure of the database and initialize it by reading initialization information from another file.

<!-- CLIENT SIDE -->

### Fronted Components

The frontend has been developed as VueJS app, using the NuxtJS framework.

#### Cards

-   `PersonCard.vue` is used to show syntetized information about a person. It contains the profile picture, the name and the surname of the subject.
-   `ResourceCard.vue` is used to show syntetized information about a given resource.
-   `ServiceCard.vue` is used to show syntetized information about a given service.
-   `ThreatCard.vue` is used to show information about a possible Threat.

#### Items

-   `ButtonComponent.vue` is a button which can be used both for navigation and as a click event generator.
-   `ImageComponent.vue` is made up of an image, a text description and a ButtonComponent; it is used to show syntetized information about a person or an area.
-   `InputComponent.vue` is used to model an input or a textarea for a form.
-   `TimelineComponent.vue` is used to highlight how many resources, grouped by type, are available for a given year.
-   `TitleComponent.vue` is used to add a simple title and optionally a paragraph to a more complex element.

#### Menus

-   `AppMenu.vue` is used to model landmarks which are embedded both in the header and in the footer of the page.
-   `SocialMenu.vue` is used to model social logos which are embedded in the footer of the page.

#### Sections

-   `AltSection.vue` is a section which contains a title, an optional set of paragraphs and an optional button. It is used in almost all pages to give a description of the context.
-   `FilterSection.vue` is a section which allow the user to filter resources by type. It contains one button component to see all the resources and one button component for each type of resource present.
-   `FormSection.vue` is a section which allow the user to contact the responsible of the enterprise.
-   `GridSection.vue` is a section which allow to visualize cards of different types. It has a wide usage within the website in order to show all previews of a given collection of elements.
-   `ImageComponentsSection.vue` is a section which lists a group of ImageComponents. It can be used either to display Areas or People which have a significant role within the given context.
-   `MainSection.vue` is the first section you see in almost each page. It contains a title, optionally both a subtitles and a group of buttons, and an image. It also shows bread crumbs where needed, supporting the implementation of the index pattern.
-   `TimelineSection.vue` is the section which shows a list of TimelineComponents.

#### Singletons

-   `TheChat.vue` is implemented in the default layout and allow the user to interact with a multimodal chat bot.
-   `TheFooter.vue` is the footer of the website. It is implemented in the default layout and wrapps the AppMenu and the SocialMenu.
-   `TheHeader.vue` is the header of the website. It is implemented in the default layout and wraps the AppMenu.

<!-- ADDITIONAL PLUGINS -->

### Plugins

#### Dotenv

Used to retrieve database credentials from the environment also in development mode. It is a best practice to retrieve such these information from the environment, rather than hardcoding them.

#### Redirect SSL

Used in order to force the usage of HTTPS protocol, rather than sending data over plain HTTP.

#### Multi Modal Chatbot Creator

Experimental framework developed by PHD students of the Hypermedia Application course to support a multi modal chatbot.

#### Store

Used both to support chatbot features and static content used in several sections in order to avoid code replication.

#### Router

VueJS plugin which allow to manage easily inter and intra page routing. In addition, we developed a customized middleware plugin to support smooth scrolling behaviour for the router.

#### Robots

Nuxt plugin that manages the creation of the robots.txt file.

### Chat Bot Integration
To complete the Part 2 of the chat bot optional project, we followed the documentation available at [Multi Modal Chatbot Creator] (https://gitlab.com/i3lab/mmcc/frontend/mmcc-vue/-/blob/master/README.md).
At the beginning, the user is asked whether he wants explore the website or he wants to contact the company.
If the user wants to explore the website, the chatbot first introduce itself, then it shows the home and the about page of the website
If the user wants to contact the company, the chatbot asks whether the user want to fulfill a form or go to the contact page. In either case, it redirects the user to the correct page.
The configuration file used for the integration of the chatbot can be found at `./chatbot/config/chat-bot.json` and reflect the model provided by the assignment specification.
N.B. at the current state of the art of the provided backend of the `Multi Modal Chatbot Creator`, there is no native way of performing a loop upon reaching the end activity, even if the `next_id` field of the `end` task is set to a previous activity. Moreover, upon reaching the terminal state, the user will receive the same terminal answer for each additional message sent. We have already informed developers which will provide in the next versione a `reset` callbat to support such this behaviour. To follow the exact model provided by specification, we didn't apply any custom patch.
